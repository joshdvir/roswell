{"name":"Roswell","tagline":"A simple self-hosted password management server","body":"# Roswell\r\n\r\nRoswell is a simple rails app that allows you to share passwords, notes, and software licenses with select groups of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Account Screenshot](https://github.com/downloads/blahed/roswell/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Four types of: generic accounts, web accounts, licenses, and notes\r\n* Unified search\r\n* Simple user and group management\r\n* Organize items by one or more groups\r\n* Restrict users to only certain groups\r\n* A favorites list for frequently used entries\r\n* Single click copy-to-clipboard\r\n\r\n### How secure is Roswell it?\r\n\r\nNot extremely secure, but more secure than a shared google spreadsheet. Passwords are encrypted server-side before they are stored in mongo. The key to decrypt is stored on the server, so if your server is compromised, the passwords could be compromised. The `production` environment requires SSL, this is to ensure that cleartext passwords aren't sent/received over the wire.\r\n\r\n### How can it be more secure?\r\n\r\nClient-side encryption seems to be a popular solution, but can be complex to implement and a little cumbersome to use. The hope was to figure out the UI and the workflow for creating/sharing/grouping/retrieving passwords, and then figure out how to make it more secure. Really, we just needed something better than a spreadsheet.\r\n\r\n## Installing Roswell\r\n\r\nRoswell is just a rails app so clone it down somewhere and:\r\n\r\n    > bundle              # install gem dependencies\r\n    > rake roswell:setup  # create your encryption key file and an admin user\r\n\r\nThen just start your choice of server (you'll wanna put it behind SSL).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Create & configure for Heroku\r\n\r\n\t> gem install heroku\r\n\t> heroku create example-roswell --stack cedar\r\n\t> heroku addons:add mongolab:starter\r\n\t> heroku config:add HEROKU=true\r\n\t> heroku config:add ROSWELL_KEY=`ruby -r securerandom -e \"puts SecureRandom.hex(64)\"`\r\n\t> git push heroku master\r\n\t> heroku run rake roswell:create_admin_user\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* Ruby 1.9\r\n* MongoDB\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
